# Snippetbox

A simple web application that lets users paste and share snippets of text, written in Go.

This project is based on the walkthrough from Alex Edwards' excellent book *Let's Go*. I'm using it as a hands-on way to learn Go and improve my web development skills.

While much of the code follows the structure in the book, I'm also modifying and adding my own features as I go.

> 📚 Highly recommend supporting the author and checking out the book:
